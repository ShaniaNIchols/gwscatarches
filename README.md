# gwscatarches
This program is used to determine characteristics of a scattering surfaces. Produces a Q Spectrogram of the gravitational wave strain and a 2D plot of Frequency vs Time from the Q Spectrogram data. From the scattering equation, f_max = 2/lambda * (x_scat)(f_scat), the velocity of the scattering surface can be determined. Where f_max is the average maximum frequency of the scattering arches, x_scat is the distance the surface vibrates away from the equilibrium position, and f_scat is the frequency of oscillation of the surface. The velocity of the surfave is (x_scat)*(f_scat). The average time interval between scattering arches and the number of arches in the event are also calculated. Written by Shania A.
